Description
"Help Jimmy" Is shown in the following image scene on the game. 
 
A plurality of the length and the height of different platform includes the scene. The ground is the lowest platform, height is zero, infinite length. 

Jimmy mice at time 0 from somewhere above all platform to start falling, its falling speed is 1 m / S. When Jimmy falls to a platform, players choose to make it to the left or right away, its running speed is 1 m / s. When Jimmy ran to the edge of the platform, begin to fall. Height can not be Jimmy each falling more than MAX meters, or I will be killed, the game will end. 

Design a program to calculate the earliest time possible, Jimmy exactly when the ground. 

Input
The first line is the number of groups of t test data(0 <= t <= 20). The first line of each test case is the four integers N, X, Y, MAX, separated by spaces. N is the number of platform (not including ground), X and Y is the beginning of the Jimmy vertical coordinate the whereabouts of the location, MAX is the maximum height of a fall. Each of the next N lines describe a platform, including three integers, X1[i], X2[i] and H[i]. H[i]Said the height of the platform, the abscissa X1[i] and X2[i] platform around the endpoint of the. 1 <= N <= 1000, -20000 <= X, X1[i], X2[i] <= 20000, 0 <H[i] <Y <= 20000(i = 1..N). All coordinates of the units are meters. 

The size of Jimmy and the platform are negligible thickness. If Jimmy happens to fall on a certain platform edge, be regarded as falling on the platform. All of the platform are not overlap or. The test data to ensure the problem always has a solution. 

Output
Each test data for the input, output one integer, the earliest time possible Jimmy exactly when the ground.
